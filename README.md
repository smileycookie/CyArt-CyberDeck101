## ðŸ“– Overview

CyArt-CyberDeck is a powerful solution for collecting, aggregating, and monitoring logs and security events from multiple systems.

This repository includes two main setup guides:

1. **Agent Setup Guide** (`Requirements.txt`) â€“ How to install Tailscale and connect to the Wazuh server.  
2. **Project Installation Guide** (`README.md`) â€“ How to unzip files, install dependencies, and run the backend/frontend.
