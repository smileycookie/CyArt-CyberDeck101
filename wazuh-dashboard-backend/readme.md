## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Run `npm install` After Cloning

If you‚Äôve just cloned this project and see errors like:

### "Error: Cannot find module 'express'" or other module not found errors ###

This is likely because the project dependencies have not been installed yet.

## ‚úÖ Quick Start Guide

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git)
    ```
2.  **Change the Directory to "backend"**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
3.  **Install the dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Start the development server**
    ```bash
    node server-minimal.js
    ```
5.  **If it still gives you errors, you will have to install the dependencies according to the errors which you will face when you try to run it for the first time.**
    ```bash
    take the help of the A.I Models/Tools to dectect the required dependencies
    ```
6.  **According to the output of the A.I Models/Tools, you have to install the dependencies one-by-one.**
    ```bash
    npm install <dependency_name>
    ```
